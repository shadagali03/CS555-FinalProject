# Voice Assistant for Seniors

## Main Objective of the Project

The project focuses on developing a voice assistant specifically tailored for seniors, aiming to promote healthy behaviors and provide essential health-related reminders. The voice assistant offers a seamless interface for seniors to interact with, allowing them to ask health-related questions and receive accurate responses.

This tool is designed to help seniors manage their daily activities, such as:

- Walking
- Checking blood pressure
- Taking medication

The assistant provides timely voice reminders to support these activities. By utilizing speech as the primary mode of interaction, the assistant is simple and intuitive, catering to the needs of older users who may struggle with more complex technology.

### Inclusivity and Accessibility

The project emphasizes **multi-language support** to cater to a diverse group of seniors from different linguistic backgrounds. The voice assistant guarantees inclusivity by offering reminders and health information in multiple languages.

The system is also equipped with:

- Data storage for tracking interactions and performance
- Robust error-handling mechanisms for a smooth experience

Ultimately, the project focuses on improving seniors' quality of life by making it easier for them to manage their health, stay active, and adhere to important health routines.
